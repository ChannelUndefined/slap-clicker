Chris Rock Slapping Idle Game
 
 The most recent game to be developed by me.
 
Following the dying trend relating to "The slap heard across the world", also known as the Chris Rock slap. This game is like any other idle clicker such as Cookie Clicker, however you earn slaps by slapping Chris Rock.

It is a basic static web page which stores your progress in cookies. You can easily host this on Glitch or Replit.
I initially created this as a meme game for playing during school.
 
 This is open source because it was low effort for me, and because I am no longer working on this. It is missing multiple images for different purchases.
